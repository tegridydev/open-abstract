# open-abstract

**OpenAbstract** is an open-source, decentralized wiki alternative built on blockchain technology. The goal is to provide a transparent, tamper-proof, and community-driven platform for storing and sharing knowledge, free from centralized control or censorship.

## **Key Features**
- **Decentralized Knowledge Storage**: Leverages blockchain technology for permanent, tamper-proof storage of verified information.
- **Community Moderation**: Contributors and moderators maintain the platform through staking-based governance.
- **Reward System**: High-quality contributions are incentivized with reward tokens to encourage engagement and maintain content quality.
- **Transparency**: All edits and contributions are recorded on-chain, ensuring trust and accountability.

## **Why OpenAbstract?**
In an era of misinformation and centralized control, OpenAbstract provides a reliable, censorship-resistant platform for sharing knowledge. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures that all data is:
1. **Immutable**: Content cannot be altered maliciously.
2. **Transparent**: All contributions and moderation actions are publicly verifiable.
3. **Community-Owned**: Governance and rewards are distributed among users, ensuring a democratic ecosystem.

## **Built on Abstract**
OpenAbstract is powered by Abstract, a scalable and secure Ethereum Layer 2 network. Abstract's low-cost transactions, advanced cryptography, and consumer-centric design make it the ideal platform for a decentralized wiki.
